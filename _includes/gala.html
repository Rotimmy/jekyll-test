          <h3>2023 Gala</h3>
          <p>On May 11, 2023, we commemorated the annual Innocence Project Gala — “A Celebration of Justice and Freedom.” With an impressive turnout of over 700 guests, the highlight of the gala was the introduction of our exonerees, who were met with an electrifying standing ovation from the audience.</p>
          <p>This extraordinary evening co-chaired by Sara Naison-Tarajano and Steven Alan Reiss raised over $2 million. The success of this year’s gala is a testament to the unwavering commitment of both our exonerees and the dedicated individuals working tirelessly to forge a more equitable and just criminal legal system for all.</p>
